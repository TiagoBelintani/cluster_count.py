# Cluster Occupancy Analyzer üï∑Ô∏è

A simple Python script to evaluate the taxon occupancy of ortholog clusters generated by MCL-based clustering pipelines, such as those used in phylogenomic workflows (e.g. Phyluce).

## ‚ú® Overview

This script parses clusters of orthologs stored as FASTA files, calculates:

- The number of clusters per dataset
- The mean taxon occupancy per cluster (based on a user-defined total number of taxa)
- The number of clusters that meet key taxon occupancy thresholds (‚â•10%, ‚â•50%, ‚â•75%)

Useful for evaluating different BLAST/MCL thresholds (e.g., `hit_4`, `hit_10`, `hit_50`, `hit_100`) and choosing the most informative cluster set for downstream analyses such as alignment, trimming, and tree reconstruction.
